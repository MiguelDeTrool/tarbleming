This is my take on the Music Thing Modular Turing Machine/Mutable Instruments Marbles, in an easier to implement fashion, with easily available through-hole parts. I must warn anyone attempting this that I have not tested these exact PCBs, only an earlier prototype, that I then made minor modifications to for this version. I am quite confident that they will work, and feel free to send me a message if you decide to try this out. I wouldn't recommend this to a complete beginner, as I have provided no build guide.

You'll also notice a manual is missing. Basic functionality to get up and running is send it a clock signal. Each sequence, wether Gate or CV, can have it's own length. Tap the corresponding button for however many steps you want, then do a quick double tap to confirm that value. Turn a sequence's Randomness knob fully clockwise for it to constantly change, and fully counter-clockwise for it to lock in a looping pattern. And again, if you have questions, feel free to send a message.
